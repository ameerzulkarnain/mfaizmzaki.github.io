# Data Science Meet #2

_31 March 2017_

#### CIMB Data Science Challenge
##### Online Assessment: Discussion


###### Question 1

The 3 V's of Big Data [Gartner, 2001].
- Volume
- Velocity
- Variety

Definition of Big Data has since expanded to cover more characteristics as it evolves through out the years. IBM introduced 4 V's. There are also 5 V's, 7 V's etc...

###### Question 2
In 2013, total amount of data in the world = 4.4 zettabytes [[Khoso, 2016]](http://www.northeastern.edu/levelblog/2016/05/13/how-much-data-produced-every-day/). By 2020, figure expected = 44 zettabytes. Petabytes and exabytes are out of the question as they're lower than zettabytes. 300 zettabytes is too high in comparison to the mentioned projection. Therefore, the answer?

###### Question 3
Data Mining. It involves machine learning and other computational process. Data Digging? Never heard of that. Try searching and discuss. 

###### Question 4
Warehouse Management and Reporting. Discuss

###### Question 5
None are correct. The sample stats can be larger, lower or equal to the population stats. The sample is just an estimate for the population parameter. 

###### Question 6
It's an average. Computed by summing the data values and dividing the sum by the number of items.

###### Question 7
Arrange in ascending order. Take the average of the two middle values. 

###### Question 8
Mode.

###### Question 9
Standard dev = sqrt of variance. Therefore var = 9^2^ = 81.

###### Question 10
40 cows eat 40 bags in 40 days. 
In 1 day, 40 bags / 40 days, 40 cows eat 1 bag. 
In 1 day, 1 cow eats 1/40 bag. 
Question: How many days for 1 cow to eat 1 bag?
1 day = 1/40
x days = 1
1/40 * x = 1
x = 40 days

###### Question 11
Avg = sum of numbers / 20 = 0. Hence sum = 0 since 0 divided by any number = 0. 
Question: How many of the 20 numbers is > 0 at most? 19. Why? You can have all the numbers in the world representing the 19 numbers. But since the sum = 0, the 20th number must be the -ve of all the 19 numbers. 

###### Question 12
2^3^ = 8.

###### Question 13
I and III. Similar to a XOR gate. Logic.

###### Question 14
MNOP. In each step, number of letters and letter skips increased by 1. A, (B), CD, (EF), GHI, (JKL), MNOP, (QRST), UVWXY.

###### Question 15
Some artist maybe drug addicts. 'Prone' is not an absolute agreement. 

###### Question 16
14 is an even number in the series. 

###### Question 17
The pattern is: multiplication by 3 followed by division by 2. 54/2 = 27.

###### Question 18
The regression equation:
_y = 79.9(age) - 503.9(female) + 1140.6(married) + 922.1_
Interpretation: 
- The monthly income increases by 79.9 when age increases by 1. 
- The monthly income decreases by 503.9 when the gender is female.
- The monthly income increases by 1140.6 if customer is married.

Therefore, older customers are expected to have higher income. 

###### Question 19
Just plug the values into the regression equation and multiply by 12 to get the estimated annual income. 

_estimated monthly income = 79.9(45) - 503.9(0) + 1140.6(0) + 922.1_ 
_estimated monthly income = 4517.6_
_estimated annual income = 12(4517.6)  = 54211.2_

###### Question 20
The _t_ value and _p_ value of the gender variable are too low and too high respectively to prove significance.
